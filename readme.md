Topic modeling is a very important task in the natural language processing world.
Using topic modeling techniques, we can extract the most important topics from the text data.
The topic modeling algirithms are :
1. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)
2. Latent Dirichilet Allocation (LDA)

The LDA algorithm is implemented using the popular NLP library Gensim.
The feature used here is TF-IDF.
You can set the number of topics you want to extract from the text.
